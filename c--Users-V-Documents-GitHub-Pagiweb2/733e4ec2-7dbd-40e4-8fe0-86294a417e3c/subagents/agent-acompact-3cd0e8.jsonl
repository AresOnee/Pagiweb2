In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.\n\nHere's an example of how your output should be structured:\n\n<example>\n<analysis>\n[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1.

I've checked the major ones but there are still many documents with embedded images I haven't visually inspected.\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The conversation spans multiple phases:\n   \n   **Phase 1 - Image Quality Fix**: User wanted all 32 newly converted product images at quality 100 (not 80). Initially misunderstood as wanting quality 80, but user clarified \"te pedi las imagens al 100 no al 80\". Re-converted all 32 images at WebP quality 100.\n   \n   **Phase 2 - Image Curation**: User provided detailed instructions to remove/rearrange images across 15 products in two batches. Numbering convention: image 1 = main `image` field, image 2+ = `images` array items (1-indexed).\n   \n   **Phase 3 - Company Description File**: User requested creation of a file describing the company and all products.\n   \n   **Phase 4 - Missing Products Analysis**: User asked what products are missing to complete a full grounding system.\n   \n   **Phase 5 - Image Mining from Reports (CURRENT)**: User wants me to extract images from documents (.docx, .pdf, .pptx) in the `Productos/` directory to find images for products that are missing from the catalog. User explicitly said NOT to check `Fotos GelChile/` or `moldes/` (already analyzed). After initial extraction and review, user said **\"necesito que sigas buscando mas imagenes\"** — they want me to continue searching for more images in the remaining documents I haven't visually inspected yet.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Astro SSG** with Content Collections validated by Zod schemas (58 products, 65 pages)\n   - **Sharp image processing** for WebP conversion (quality parameter: 80 default, user wants 100)\n   - **DOCX files are ZIP archives** — images extracted from `word/media/` folder using `unzip`\n   - **PPTX files** similarly extractable from `ppt/media/`\n   - **Product JSON schema**: sku, title, category, categorySlug, description, features, specs, image (main), images (optional gallery array), inStock, badge\n   - **Image numbering convention**: image 1 = `image` field (main), image 2 = `images[0]`, image 3 = `images[1]`, etc.\n   - **SKU pattern**: `[A-Z]{2,3}-[A-Z0-9]{1,3}` (e.g., CEX-010, MOL-B)\n   - **categories.json** count field must match actual product count per category\n   - **Image paths**: `/assets/img/products/foo.webp` maps to `public/assets/img/products/foo.webp`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`DESCRIPCION_EMPRESA_Y_PRODUCTOS.md`** (NEW)\n     - Comprehensive document describing GelChile, all 58 products grouped by 9 categories, and how a complete grounding system is assembled\n     \n   - **`src/content/products/cex-010.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Swapped main image: `cex-010-alt.webp` is now principal, `cex-010.webp` moved to images array\n     ```json\n     \"image\": \"/assets/img/products/cex-010-alt.webp\",\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-010.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/par-002.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed images 5,6 (mas-005.webp, mas-006.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/mas-004.webp\", \"/assets/img/products/mas-001.webp\", \"/assets/img/products/mas-002.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-009.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed image 3 (cex-009-alt2.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-009-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-001.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed images 2,4,5 — kept only cex-001-alt2.webp\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-001-alt2.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-003.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed images 3,4 — kept only cex-003-alt.webp\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-003-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-002.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Kept only images 1 and 3 (main + cex-002-alt2.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-002-alt2.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-004.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed image 3 (cex-004-caja.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-004-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-005.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed image 3 (cex-005-caja.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-005-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-006.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed image 3 (cex-006-caja.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-006-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cex-007.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed image 3 (cex-007-caja.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cex-007-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/par-003.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed image 3 (par-003-alt.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/chi-001.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/ele-004.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Deleted image 1 (main), promoted image 2 to main, removed images array\n     ```json\n     \"image\": \"/assets/img/products/electrode-he-200-alt.webp\",\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/ele-005.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed images 2 and 5 (electrode-he-400-product.webp, ele-005-pack2.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/electrode-he-400-detail.webp\", \"/assets/img/products/electrode-he-400-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/ele-006.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Removed images 2 and 5 (electrode-he-700-product.webp, ele-006-pack2.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/electrode-he-700-detail.webp\", \"/assets/img/products/electrode-he-700-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/content/products/cam-001.json`** (EDITED)\n     - Kept only images 1 and 2 (main cam-001.webp + cam-001-alt.webp)\n     ```json\n     \"images\": [\"/assets/img/products/cam-001-alt.webp\"],\n     ```\n\n   - **32 WebP images in `public/assets/img/products/`** re-converted at quality 100\n\n   - **Extracted images from documents** to `tmp_imgs/` directory and `/tmp/docx_images/` for visual inspection\n\n   - **Image audit results**: 144 referenced images all exist. 94 orphaned images (user chose to keep them).\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Misunderstanding image quality**: Initially thought user wanted quality 80, but user said \"te pedi las imagens al 100 no al 80\". First conversion at q80 showed 0% change (images were already q80). Re-converted at q100 successfully with significant size increases.\n   - **Misunderstanding \"search for images\"**: User asked to check reports for images for missing products. I initially did an image audit (checking if referenced images exist on disk). User corrected: \"creo que no entendiste mi instrucciones, necesito que busques o puedas sacar nuevas imagenes para los productos que faltan, busca en los informes\". Then I extracted images from .docx/.pptx files.\n   - **File path issues on Windows**: `/tmp/` paths didn't work for the Read tool on Windows. Fixed by copying extracted images to `c:\\Users\\V\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pagiweb2\\tmp_imgs\\` instead.\n   - **Node.js escape character issue**: `\\!` in Node.js script caused \"Expected unicode escape\" error. Fixed by using bash commands instead.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Image extraction from DOCX**: Solved by recognizing DOCX files are ZIP archives, using `unzip` to extract `word/media/` contents\n   - **Identifying useful images**: Visually inspected extracted images to classify which are product photos vs logos vs certificates vs diagrams\n   - **Missing products analysis**: Identified Cable de Cobre Desnudo, Fleje de Cobre, DPS, Abrazaderas, Barra equipotencial, Cable de bajada, Telurómetro as missing from catalog\n   - **Found Cable de Cobre image**: Clean product photo in `Servicio Malla de fleje/WhatsApp Image 2026-01-28 at 20.35.43.jpeg`\n\n6.

Current Work:\n   I was extracting and visually inspecting images embedded in documents (.docx, .pptx, .pdf) from the `Productos/` directory to find images that could be used for products missing from the catalog. I had extracted images from all 18 docx/pptx files and visually inspected approximately 16 key images. I presented my findings showing that the only new product with a usable image is \"Cable de Cobre Desnudo 19 Hebras\", while several existing products could get additional images from the documents.\n\n   The user responded **\"necesito que sigas buscando mas imagenes\"** — they want me to continue searching.\n\n   Images already extracted to `/tmp/docx_images/` from 18 documents.
