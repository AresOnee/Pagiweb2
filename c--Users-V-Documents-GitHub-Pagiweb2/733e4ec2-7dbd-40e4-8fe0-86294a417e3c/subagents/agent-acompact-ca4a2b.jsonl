A detailed summary was provided covering extensive previous work on GelChile website performance optimizations.\n\n2. **Previous Context Summary Key Points**:\n   - User asked for performance improvements before production\n   - CSS deduplication work was done (creating product-card.css, cleaning up duplicated styles)\n   - A linter reportedly reverted some changes\n   - Lighthouse showed 96/100 on dev server with \"Avoid large network payloads\" warning\n   - User chose \"Optimizar de todas formas\"\n   - A plan was written at `C:\\Users\\V\\.claude\\plans\\adaptive-crafting-quail.md`\n\n3. **My First Actions in This Session**:\n   - Read `src/pages/productos/index.astro` - saw description not truncated (line 17)\n   - Read `src/components/ProductCard.astro` - saw it still had `<style>` block (lines 73-363)\n   - Tried to read `src/styles/product-card.css` - FILE DID NOT EXIST\n   - Read `MainLayout.astro` - did NOT have product-card.css import\n   - Read `ProductFilter.tsx` - still used CSS Modules (`import styles from './ProductFilter.module.css'`)\n   - Glob for `src/styles/*.css` showed only 3 files (no product-card.css)\n\n4. **I concluded all previous changes were reverted** and updated the plan accordingly. Updated plan to say product-card.css needs to be created from scratch.\n\n5. **ExitPlanMode was called** - User REJECTED it with: \"vuelve a analizar ya actualice los archivos y ahora estan los cambios anteriores, no fueron revertidos\"\n   - This means the user manually applied/restored the changes between my file reads!\n\n6. **Second verification round**:\n   - Glob `src/styles/*.css` - NOW shows 4 files including `product-card.css`\n   - `MainLayout.astro` line 13 - NOW has `import '../styles/product-card.css';`\n   - `ProductCard.astro` - NOW ends at line 71, `<style>` block REMOVED\n   - `AddToQuoteBtn.tsx` - NOW uses CSS classes (`class=\"btn-add-quote\"`, etc.), inline styles removed\n   - `ProductFilter.tsx` lines 300-399 - NOW uses global classes (`\"product-card\"`, `\"product-image\"`, etc.)\n   - `ProductFilter.module.css` - NOW cleaned, only 363 lines (filters/search/grid/responsive, no product card styles)\n\n7. **Updated plan** to reflect that CSS dedup was already done, only description truncation remained.\n\n8. **ExitPlanMode called again** - User APPROVED.\n\n9. **Implementation**:\n   - Edited `src/pages/productos/index.astro` line 17: changed `description: p.data.description,` to truncation logic\n   - Ran `npm run build` - SUCCESS: 63 pages, 0 errors, 5.04s\n   - Checked file size: `dist/productos/index.html` went from 178,569 bytes to 159,618 bytes (~19KB savings)\n\n10. **System reminders** showed various files were modified (by user or linter), confirming the current state of product-card.css, ProductCard.astro, and index.astro.\n\n11. **User said \"revertir esos cambios\"** - asking to revert.\n\n12. **I reverted** the description truncation in `productos/index.astro` back to `description: p.data.description,`.\n\nSo the current state is:\n- CSS dedup changes are all in place (done by user, not by me in this session):\n  - `product-card.css` exists with shared styles\n  - `MainLayout.astro` imports it\n  - `ProductCard.astro` has no `<style>` block\n  - `ProductFilter.tsx` uses global classes\n  - `ProductFilter.module.css` is cleaned\n  - `AddToQuoteBtn.tsx` uses CSS classes\n- Description truncation was REVERTED per user's request\n- No pending tasks explicitly requested\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - The user originally asked for performance improvements to the GelChile website before production deployment (\"que mejoras del rendimiento puede hacer en la pagina web antes de salir a produccion?\")\n   - In this continued session, the focus was on completing remaining Lighthouse optimizations for the `/productos` page\n   - The user had already manually applied the CSS deduplication changes and wanted me to recognize that state\n   - The user's final request was to **revert** the description truncation optimization (\"revertir esos cambios\")\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Astro 5.17.1** SSG framework with Preact islands\n   - **CSS deduplication**: Extracting shared product card styles from multiple sources (ProductCard.astro scoped styles, ProductFilter.module.css) into a single global `product-card.css`\n   - **Island serialization payload**: ProductFilter island receives 56 products as props, serialized as JSON in HTML (~45KB)\n   - **CSS Modules vs Global CSS**: ProductFilter.tsx was converted from CSS Module references (`styles['product-card']`) to global class strings (`\"product-card\"`)\n   - **Lighthouse performance**: Dev server shows inflated payload due to Vite/Astro dev tools (~1.2MB)\n   - **Build output**: 63 static pages, production HTML for /productos was 178KB before truncation, 160KB after\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`src/pages/productos/index.astro`**\n     - Maps product collection data to `ProductSlim[]` for the ProductFilter island\n     - I changed line 17 to truncate descriptions to 120 chars, then REVERTED per user request\n     - Current state (reverted):\n     ```typescript\n     const products: ProductSlim[] = allProducts.map(p => ({\n       sku: p.data.sku,\n       title: p.data.title,\n       category: p.data.category,\n       categorySlug: p.data.categorySlug,\n       description: p.data.description,\n       image: p.data.image,\n       inStock: p.data.inStock,\n       badge: p.data.badge,\n       subcategories: p.data.subcategories,\n       hasVariants: (p.data.variants?.length ?? 0) > 0,\n     }));\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/styles/product-card.css`** (EXISTS - created/restored by user)\n     - ~329 lines of unified product card styles (base + dark mode)\n     - Includes: `.product-card`, `.product-link`, `.product-image`, `.product-badge`, `.badge-popular`, `.badge-pro`, `.product-content`, `.product-meta-row`, `.product-category`, `.variant-indicator`, `.application-tags`, `.app-tag`, `.product-title`, `.product-description`, `.product-sku-row`, `.product-sku`, `.card-stock`, `.out-stock`, `.stock-dot`, `.product-footer`, `.btn-add-quote` (base, hover, added, no-stock), plus dark mode overrides with `[data-theme=\"dark\"]`\n\n   - **`src/layouts/MainLayout.astro`** (MODIFIED - has import)\n     - Line 13: `import '../styles/product-card.css';`\n     ```typescript\n     import '../styles/global.css';\n     import '../styles/dark-mode.css';\n     import '../styles/animations.css';\n     import '../styles/product-card.css';\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/components/ProductCard.astro`** (MODIFIED - style block removed)\n     - File ends at line 71, no `<style>` block\n     - Markup uses global class names from product-card.css\n\n   - **`src/components/islands/ProductFilter.tsx`** (MODIFIED - uses global classes)\n     - Line 9: still `import styles from './ProductFilter.module.css';` (for filter/grid styles)\n     - Lines 314-384: product card markup uses global classes like `\"product-card\"`, `\"product-image\"`, `\"product-title\"`, etc.\n     - CSS Module references only used for filter-specific elements: `styles['product-grid']`, `styles['no-results']`, etc.\n\n   - **`src/components/islands/ProductFilter.module.css`** (MODIFIED - cleaned)\n     - ~363 lines, contains ONLY: filter buttons, subcategory pills, product grid layout, search input, sort select, no-results, dark mode for filter elements, responsive breakpoints\n     - All product card styles REMOVED\n\n   - **`src/components/islands/AddToQuoteBtn.tsx`** (MODIFIED - uses CSS classes)\n     - Inline `btnStyle`/`btnAddedStyle` objects removed\n     - Uses `class=\"btn-add-quote\"`, `class=\"btn-add-quote no-stock\"`, `class={`btn-add-quote ${existing ? 'added' : ''}`}`\n     ```tsx\n     export default function AddToQuoteBtn({ sku, title, category, image, inStock = true }: Props) {\n       const cart = useStore($cart);\n       const existing = cart.find((item) => item.sku === sku);\n       // ... uses class=\"btn-add-quote\" etc.\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`C:\\Users\\V\\.claude\\plans\\adaptive-crafting-quail.md`** - Plan file documenting the optimization strategy\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **Incorrect state assessment**: I initially concluded all previous changes were reverted (product-card.css didn't exist, MainLayout didn't have import, etc.). The user corrected me: \"vuelve a analizar ya actualice los archivos y ahora estan los cambios anteriores, no fueron revertidos\". The user had manually applied/restored the changes between my file reads. I re-read all files and confirmed the changes were present.\n   - **Plan file had stale information**: The plan stated \"product-card.css — NO existe\" when the user had already restored it. Updated the plan to reflect the actual state.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified that CSS dedup was already complete (done by user), reducing the remaining work to just description truncation\n   - Implemented description truncation: `p.data.description.length > 120 ? p.data.description.slice(0, 120) + '…' : p.data.description`\n   - Build verified: 63 pages, 0 errors, HTML size reduced from 178KB to 160KB (~19KB savings)\n   - User then asked to revert, so the truncation was undone\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - (Continuation context from previous session provided as system summary)\n   - ExitPlanMode rejected: \"vuelve a analizar ya actualice los archivos y ahora estan los cambios anteriores, no fueron revertidos\"\n   - ExitPlanMode approved (plan for description truncation)\n   - \"revertir esos cambios\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - No explicit pending tasks. The user asked to revert the description truncation, which was done. The CSS dedup changes remain in place (user-applied).\n\n8. Current Work:\n   - The last action was reverting the description truncation in `src/pages/productos/index.astro` line 17, changing it back from the truncation logic to `description: p.data.description,`\n   - This was done per the user's explicit request: \"revertir esos cambios\"\n   - The CSS dedup optimizations (product-card.css, cleaned module CSS, global classes in tsx files) remain intact as these were applied by the user and the revert request appeared to target only the truncation change I made\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   - No clear next step. The user's last request (\"revertir esos cambios\") has been completed. All optimizations from the plan have either been applied (CSS dedup - by user) or reverted (description truncation - per user request). Should wait for the user's next instruction.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1182,"cache_read_input_tokens":78241,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1182},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY9RU24QdgEh9u3Lnb1GD","type":"assistant","uuid":"1281809b-b72b-4fdf-ae5a-bfddb260e08b","timestamp":"2026-02-15T07:00:46.463Z"}
