A plan was written for updating CCD-001 (Cable de Cobre Desnudo) product with specification data from photographic tables. The product was updated with 19 variants, mm² precision corrections, and the build verified at 66 pages.\n\n2. **User message: \"el TAC son las uniones en T y el XAC son las uniones en X de los cables, analiza si es correcto lo que me dijeron\"**\n   - User informed that TAC = T-type cable connections and XAC = X-type cable connections\n   - I researched this by exploring MOL-T, MOL-X products and CEX (exothermic charge) products\n   - Confirmed this is correct: TAC matches TA mold variants in MOL-T, XAC matches XAC variant group in MOL-X\n   - The values (32, 45, 65, 90, 115, 150, 200, 250) are exothermic charge weights in grams matching CEX products exactly\n   - Web search confirmed TAC = \"Conexión horizontal de cables en T\", XAC = \"Conexión horizontal en cruz de cables coplanares\"\n\n3. **User sent 2 new images + \"entonces necesito que agregues la informacion que dice en las imagenes, tambien deja solo el tipo de cable que estan en estas tablas\"**\n   - Image 1: Full table AWG 18 to 500 MCM with TAC/XAC columns\n   - Image 2: Smaller table with 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 4/0, 250, 300\n   - User wanted: add TAC/XAC info AND keep only cable types from the tables\n   - I expanded CCD-001 to 27 variants (18 AWG to 500 MCM) with 3 groups (7/19/37 Hebras)\n   - Added TAC/XAC inline in variant labels: \"N°4 AWG (21,15 mm²) | T: 32g · X: 45g\"\n   - Build verified: 66 pages, 0 errors\n\n4. **User: \"agrega todos los grupos que salen en las tablas\"**\n   - Asked what groups user meant - user said \"a las hebras\"\n   - I explained the tables don't explicitly show hebras groups, they're determined by ASTM B8\n   - Current groups were 7 Hebras (AWG 18-3), 19 Hebras (AWG 2-4/0), 37 Hebras (250-500 MCM)\n\n5. **User: \"entonces que significan la primera columna?\"**\n   - User asking about the \"MCM\" column header\n   - I explained it's the cable gauge (AWG for small sizes, MCM for large sizes)\n   - Clarified that hebras groups don't appear in the table\n\n6. **User sent image again + \"entonces sigue lo que dice la tabla, reformula todo, ya que el cliente se rige por esa tabla\"**\n   - KEY TURNING POINT: User said to follow ONLY this specific table (image 2 with 13 calibers)\n   - Reformulated CCD-001 to exactly 13 variants: 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 4/0, 250, 300\n   - Removed all others (18-11, 9, 7, 5, 350, 400, 500 AWG, 750 MCM)\n   - Flat list (no groups), TAC/XAC inline in labels\n   - Used 21,25 mm² for 4 AWG (from this table, not 21,15 from other table)\n   - Build verified: 66 pages, 0 errors\n\n7. **User sent screenshot + \"alguna forma mas amigable de mostrar la informacion?\"**\n   - Screenshot showed the product page with long variant labels\n   - Entered plan mode\n   - Explored VariantSelector component capabilities\n   - Offered 3 options: Subtitles (recommended), Groups + specs only, Expandable table\n   - User chose \"Subtítulos (Recomendado)\"\n\n8. **Plan created and approved for subtitle implementation:**\n   - Add `subtitle` field to Zod schema, TypeScript type, and VariantSelector\n   - Add CSS classes `.labelSub` and `.cableLabelSub` with dark mode\n   - Restructure CCD-001 JSON with clean labels + subtitles + groups AWG/MCM\n\n9. **Implementation completed (5 files modified):**\n   - `content.config.ts` - Added `subtitle: z.string().optional()` to variant schema\n   - `types/index.ts` - Added `subtitle?: string` to variant type\n   - `VariantSelector.tsx` - Updated interfaces, renderVariantRow, StepConfigurator cable rows, parseHierarchy\n   - `VariantSelector.module.css` - Added `.labelSub`, `.cableLabelSub` + dark mode overrides\n   - `ccd-001.json` - Clean labels + subtitles + AWG/MCM groups\n   - Build verified: 66 pages, 0 errors\n\n10. **User: \"cambia T por TAC y cambia X por XAC\"**\n    - Simple text replacement in subtitles\n    - Changed \"Carga T:\" to \"Carga TAC:\" and \"· X:\" to \"· XAC:\" in all variant subtitles\n    - This was the last action before the summary request\n\nNo errors were encountered during implementation. The main challenge was understanding what the user wanted regarding \"groups\" which required several rounds of clarification.\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - The user provided specification tables for the CCD-001 (Cable de Cobre Desnudo) product and requested analysis, data integration, and research into what TAC and XAC columns mean\n   - TAC/XAC were confirmed as exothermic welding charge weights (grams) for T-connections (TAC) and X-connections (XAC) respectively\n   - User wanted ONLY the 13 calibers from their client table: 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 4/0, 250, 300\n   - User requested a more user-friendly way to display variant information (subtitles approach chosen)\n   - Final request: rename \"T\" to \"TAC\" and \"X\" to \"XAC\" in the subtitle text\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **TAC** = T-type A Cable connection (unión en T) — corresponds to MOL-T product's TA variants\n   - **XAC** = X-type A Cut cable connection (unión en X) — corresponds to MOL-X product's XAC variant group\n   - TAC/XAC values are exothermic charge weights in grams matching CEX products (CAP-32 through CAP-250)\n   - **AWG/MCM**: Cable gauge system (AWG for small sizes 10-1, MCM for large sizes 250+)\n   - Astro Content Collections with Zod validation for product JSON files\n   - Preact islands (VariantSelector) with CSS Modules and dark mode support\n   - VariantSelector has 4 modes: flat, three-step, two-step-bar, two-step-model\n   - New `subtitle` field added to variant schema for secondary info display\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`src/content.config.ts`** — Zod schema for product validation. Added `subtitle` optional field to variants:\n     ```ts\n     variants: z.array(z.object({\n       id: z.string(),\n       label: z.string(),\n       group: z.string().optional(),\n       subtitle: z.string().optional(),\n     })).optional(),\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/types/index.ts`** — TypeScript type definitions. Updated variant type:\n     ```ts\n     variants?: Array<{ id: string; label: string; group?: string; subtitle?: string }>;\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/components/islands/VariantSelector.tsx`** — Main variant selector Preact component. Changes:\n     - Updated `Props.variants` and `VariantItem` interfaces to include `subtitle?: string`\n     - `parseHierarchy` now passes `subtitle` through when building VariantItem objects (lines 76, 82)\n     - FlatSelector `renderVariantRow` renders subtitle (line 193):\n       ```tsx\n       <span class={styles.label}>\n         {v.label}\n         {v.subtitle && <span class={styles.labelSub}>{v.subtitle}</span>}\n         {cartQty > 0 && <span class={styles.inCart}> (en cotización: {cartQty})</span>}\n       </span>\n       ```\n     - StepConfigurator cable rows render subtitle (line 518):\n       ```tsx\n       {cable.subtitle && <span class={styles.cableLabelSub}>{cable.subtitle}</span>}\n       ```\n\n   - **`src/components/islands/VariantSelector.module.css`** — Styles for variant selector. Added:\n     - `.labelSub` after `.inCart` (~line 140): `display: block; font-size: var(--font-size-xs); color: var(--color-gray-500); font-weight: var(--font-weight-regular); margin-top: 2px; line-height: 1.3;`\n     - `.cableLabelSub` after `.cableInCart` (~line 563): same styles as `.labelSub`\n     - Dark mode overrides: `:global([data-theme=\"dark\"]) .labelSub { color: #94a3b8; }` and `:global([data-theme=\"dark\"]) .cableLabelSub { color: #94a3b8; }`\n\n   - **`src/content/products/ccd-001.json`** — Cable de Cobre Desnudo product.

Has 35 variants with `ta-` prefix IDs.\n   - **`src/content/products/mol-x.json`** — MOL-X (X-type molds) — read to confirm XAC variant group. Has 30 variants with `xa-`, `xb-`, `xbq-`, `xbz-` prefixes.\n   - **CEX products (CEX-001 through CEX-011)** — Exothermic charges confirmed matching: CAP-32 (32g), CAP-45 (45g), CAP-65 (65g), CAP-90 (90g), CAP-115 (115g), CAP-150 (150g), CAP-200 (200g), CAP-250 (250g).\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No build errors throughout the session\n   - Main challenge was understanding user intent around \"grupos\" — required multiple rounds of clarification via AskUserQuestion. User initially said \"agrega todos los grupos que salen en las tablas\", then clarified \"a las hebras\", then when I explained the tables don't show hebras groups, user said \"entonces sigue lo que dice la tabla, reformula todo\" which led to removing all non-table calibers and using a flat list\n   - 4 AWG mm² discrepancy: Image 1 showed 21,15 mm², Image 2 showed 21,25 mm². Used 21,25 since user said \"el cliente se rige por esa tabla\" (the client follows this table) referring to Image 2\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **TAC/XAC identification**: Confirmed through cross-referencing MOL-T, MOL-X products and CEX charge products in the codebase, plus web searches. Values are exothermic welding charge weights in grams for T-connections and X-connections respectively.\n   - **UI improvement**: Long variant labels (\"N°1/0 AWG (53,49 mm²) | T: 90g · X: 90g\") were hard to scan. Solved by implementing a `subtitle` system: clean primary labels + secondary gray text for TAC/XAC info, organized with AWG/MCM groups.\n   - **Schema extension**: Added `subtitle` optional field across the entire data pipeline (Zod schema → TypeScript types → component props → CSS) without breaking existing products.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"el TAC son las uniones en T y el XAC son las uniones en X de los cables, analiza si es correcto lo que me dijeron\"\n   - [2 images] \"entonces necesito que agregues la informacion que dice en las imagenes, tambien deja solo el tipo de cable que estan en estas tablas\"\n   - \"agrega todos los grupos que salen en las tablas\"\n   - (AskUserQuestion response): \"a las hebras\" (about what groups they meant)\n   - (AskUserQuestion response): \"entonces que significan la primera columna?\" (asking about the MCM column)\n   - [1 image] \"entonces sigue lo que dice la tabla, reformula todo, ya que el cliente se rige por esa tabla\"\n   - [1 screenshot] \"alguna forma mas amigable de mostrar la informacion?\"\n   - (AskUserQuestion response): \"Subtítulos (Recomendado)\" (chose subtitle approach)\n   - \"cambia T por TAC y cambia X por XAC\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - No explicitly pending tasks. All requested changes have been implemented and build-verified.\n   - The last build verification was before the \"cambia T por TAC\" edit — a final build verification could be run to confirm.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The most recent change was renaming \"T\" to \"TAC\" and \"X\" to \"XAC\" in the subtitle text of all CCD-001 variants. Two replace-all edits were made to `ccd-001.json`:\n   - `\"Carga T:\"` → `\"Carga TAC:\"`\n   - `\"· X:\"` → `\"· XAC:\"`\n   \n   The subtitles now read like `\"Carga TAC: 32g · XAC: 45g\"` instead of `\"Carga T: 32g · X: 45g\"`.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Run `npm run build` to verify the last change (TAC/XAC rename) compiles without errors, since the build was last run before this edit.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1198,"cache_read_input_tokens":140446,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1198},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYCraGMyMMQyvHi8xicUN","type":"assistant","uuid":"b9b0f103-1e97-4081-970b-fd12d246c3d9","timestamp":"2026-02-17T02:32:11.796Z"}
